Bubble Sort

Hi dear friend
One of the sorting methods is the bubble sorting method, also called the Standard Exchange method.
the sorting algorithm works as follows:
Step 1 In our list, we compare the prime number with the second number, if it is large, replace it with the second number,
```(4  3)  8  1  6  2   ->   (3  4)  8  1  6  2```
and then compare the second number with the third number, if the third is larger than the second, both remain in their numbers.
```3  (4  8)  1  6  2   ->   3  (4  8)  1  6  2 ```
We will continue to do so until the end of the list
in the first step, the largest number will be placed
and in the next steps, the other numbers will appear
this algorithm has complexity n^2 (at worst)
and at best the complexity is n
